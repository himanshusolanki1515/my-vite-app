export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! I’m Himanshu Solanki, a Full Stack Web Developer based in London, UK, currently pursuing an MSc in Management with Project Management at BPP University. I’m passionate about building intuitive, high-performing web applications that make technology accessible and enjoyable.

My journey began with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at S.N.P.I.T & R.C., India, where I developed a strong interest in coding and problem-solving. Since then, I’ve gained solid experience in front-end and back-end development, working with React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

During my internships at Lynx Softech Pvt. Ltd. and Toshal Infotech Pvt. Ltd., I built responsive interfaces, integrated APIs, and collaborated with teams to deliver seamless digital experiences—sharpening my skills in teamwork, adaptability, and clean coding.

Now, through my master’s studies, I’m developing project management and leadership skills, combining technical expertise with strategic thinking to deliver projects efficiently.

I’m always exploring new technologies, improving performance, and refining design. When I’m not coding, I enjoy learning about UI/UX, experimenting with creative ideas, and working on side projects that blend functionality with design.`;
